I model the data I got from a haber site and transferred it to the application with Alamofire. I created a detail page for the news and showed the pictures by downloading them with SDWebImage. I implemented the auto layout for the news list screen of the application programmatically. Cells used in CollectionView are dynamically designed to be sized according to the content.

## Description
Two UICollectionViews are used on the News List page.
Categories have been created for news in HeaderCollectionView. When the selection is made, the Cell shifts to the left and the news list is displayed starting from the first index. News are listed in the second collectionView. Cells are sized automatically according to the content.
